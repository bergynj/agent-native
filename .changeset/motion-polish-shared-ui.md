Motion polish across shared UI: overlay primitives (tooltip, popover, select, context/menubar menus) now scale from their trigger, exit with ease-out, and respect prefers-reduced-motion; new shared easing tokens (--ease-drawer, --ease-collapse, --ease-out-strong); press feedback on the shared Button and composer send button; GPU-friendly progress fills; chat tool cells (files-changed/edit/write) animate open/closed like other disclosures.
